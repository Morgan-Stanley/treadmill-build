Socat-server provides an unauthenticated app discovery service for a specific app, running on a high port. This is intended to provide discovery services for clients outside the domain that are unable to run treadmill discovery. 

Once running, you can curl the server at PORT and recieve the command output of treadmill discovery APPNAME

This server requires both Treadmill and Socat-specific user data to start. 

Example yaml:
---
treadmill_cell: TMCELL
treadmill_ldap: ldap://LDAPHOST:389
treadmill_ldap_suffix: DC=FOO,DC=COM
treadmill_dns_domain: FOO.COM
socat_port: PORT
socat_master_app: PROID.APPNAME
